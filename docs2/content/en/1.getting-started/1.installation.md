# Installation

Install `@nuxt/test-utils` and `jest` as development dependencies:

::code-group
```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev @nuxt/test-utils jest
```

```bash [npm]
npm install --save-dev @nuxt/test-utils jest
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
At the moment [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is the only supported test runner.
::

### End-to-end

To run the end-to-end testing, it will be necessary to install the [`playwright`](https://playwright.dev/) as development dependencies:

::code-group
```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev playwright
```

```bash [npm]
npm install --save-dev playwright
```
::

## Configuration

For a quick start simply add `@nuxt/test-utils` preset to `jest.config` file:

```js [jest.config.js]
export default {
  preset: '@nuxt/test-utils'
}
```

::alert{type="warning"}
The preset configures `testEnvironment`, `transform` and `transformIgnorePatterns` options. Note that including them additionally in the `jest.config` would override [the preset values](https://github.com/nuxt/test-utils/blob/main/jest-preset.js).

## Use with Vue Test Utils

Might be your project already includes Jest, for instance, to test Vue components using [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org). Keep in mind that `@vue/test-utils` is running tests in Jestâ€™s browser-like, but `@nuxt/test-utils` requires node-like [test environment](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string).

It is recommended to create a separate `jest.config` file for tests which use Nuxt Test Utils. For example, if components tests are located in `test/unit` and end-to-end tests are placed inside `test/e2e` directory, set up your `package.json` scripts like this:

```json [package.json]
"scripts": {
  "test": "yarn test:unit && yarn test:e2e",
  // configuration for Nuxt Test Utils
  "test:e2e": "jest test/e2e -c jest.config.e2e.js",
  "test:unit": "jest test/unit"
}
```

Usually end-to-end tests are slow. Running them separately will also help to keep unit tests performant.

## Advanced Configuration

Instead of using the preset you may also configure Jest manually. For example, to use your preferred [transformer](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object):

```js [jest.config.js]
export default {
  // add if your Jest version is lower than 27.0
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  // use any transformers you like
  transform: {
    '\\.ts$': 'ts-jest' 
  },
  // add to transpile packages in ESM syntax
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    'node_modules/(?!(nuxt-i18n)/)'
  ]
}
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Currently Jest does not transpile files found inside `node_modules`. Therefore, packages published in ESM syntax (e.g., [`nuxt-i18n`](https://github.com/nuxt-community/i18n-module) module) will cause an error. To make them reachable for the transformers use [`transformIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring) option.
